# Call sync twice
# https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync.2.html
# According to POXIS, sync can "finish" before actually "finishing"
# But the next sync cannot start until the initial completion is done.
# Linux technically avoids this at an FS level, but just to be safe
# calling sync twice will ensure that by the time the second one
# returns, the first one is done
