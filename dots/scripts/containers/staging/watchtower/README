# watchtower

Symlink the script from `/usr/local/bin/watchtower` to `${HOME}/.containers/bin/watchtower`
to use with `systemctl --user start containerize@watchtower`

## Why doesn't it work?
Watchtower only updates an image with "the same tag".
We generally want to pin to an image tag, but watch "latest" for updates.
Watchtower will not do that :(
