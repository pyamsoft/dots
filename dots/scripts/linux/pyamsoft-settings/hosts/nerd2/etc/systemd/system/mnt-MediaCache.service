# Run a systemd unit when an external USB disk is mounted
#
# Normally, external disks are mounted by udisks2
# but the path can be inconsistent, or user specific
#
# We want automount behavior that is system available, and the ability
# to chain other services off of the mountpoint
#
# Adding our external disk as "nofail" in the fstab stops udisks2 from auto mounting us
#
# So instead, we work around it with this "path activates service which activates mount"


# Need this line in /etc/fstab
#
# /MediaCache (External USB disk)
# LVM mounted disk
#/dev/MediaCache/media_backing           /mnt/MediaCache  ext4   rw,noatime,discard,nofail,defaults,auto,rw,nosuid,nodev,errors=remount-ro                                      0 2
