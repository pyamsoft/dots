# Neovim Setup

We use AstroNvim, which comes with a "clone the repository" kind of template.
To avoid deviating too much from upstream, we apply our customization as a
series of patches over the upstream release.

## How
Run `applypatches` to apply all of our nvim patches

### What

1. Turn off relative line numbers
2. Enable soft line wrapping
