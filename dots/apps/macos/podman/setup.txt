You will need to setup the podman machine as rootful for AdguardHome

$ podman machine init --rootful

Then once setup you must start the machine and SSH into it

podman machine ssh

Once inside coreos, you must edit systemd-resolved at /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
to not run a local stub listener `DNSStubListener=no`.

Unlink `/etc/resolv.conf` and add a file pointing to `nameserver 127.0.0.1`

Then restart systemd-resolved, and you can launch adguardhome
