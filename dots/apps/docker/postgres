# The name of the container to run

# CONTAINER_TARGET="adguard/adguardhome"
CONTAINER_TARGET="postgres:15"

# Directories: Format like -v/--volume. Paths will be automatically prepended with this directory path
# This does not use docker volumes, just host directory bind mounts.
# Ex: config becomes -> "-v /usr/local/etc/docker/my_app/config"
#
# CONTAINER_DIRS="directory:/root/directory"
CONTAINER_DIRS="data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"

# Ports: Format like -p/--port
# Will be prepended with the -p option
# Ex: 80:80/tcp -> "-p 80:80/tcp"
#
# CONTAINER_PORTS="80:80/tcp 443:443/tcp"
CONTAINER_PORTS="127.0.0.1:5432:5432/tcp"

# Capabilities: Format like --cap-add (these are only added, everything is DROPPED by default)
# Will be prepended with --cap-add. You may need to add capabilities, as this script is run with
# security be default of: --security-opt no-new-privileges:true --cap-drop ALL
#
# https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/oci/caps/defaults.go#L6-L19
# These are the "default" capabilities a docker container is normally created with.
#
# Ex: NET_ADMIN NET_BIND_SERVICE -> "--cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE"
#
# CONTAINER_CAPS="NET_BIND_SERVICE NET_ADMIN"
CONTAINER_CAPS="CHOWN DAC_OVERRIDE SETUID SETGID"

# User: Override the --user option passed to the container.
# Pass UID instead of names for maximum compatibility.
# This user will be parsed into the --user=uid:gid format,
# where the UID is the resolved UID of the provided user, and the group
# is the users primary Group.
# Passing "root" will remove the default functionality, which is to create and then
# use a custom docker container user
#
# To specify a custom UID:GID, you should pass "root" here and then add the --user option to
# CONTAINER_OPTIONS
#
# Ex: root -> (Removes the default --user option that would normally be passed)
# Ex: myuser -> --user=1000:1000
# Ex: 700 -> --user=700:700
#
# CONTAINER_USER="1000"
CONTAINER_USER=""

# Options: Any options passed to the container raw
# Passed directory to docker run
# 
# CONTAINER_OPTIONS="--init -i -t --read-only"
CONTAINER_OPTIONS="-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpostgrespasswd"

# Arguments: Passed directly to the command ran inside the container.
# If arguments are passed at invocation time, those will be used instead of these default args.
#
# CONTAINER_ARGS="--verbose help"
CONTAINER_ARGS=""
