# The name of the container to run

# CONTAINER_TARGET="adguard/adguardhome"
CONTAINER_TARGET="syncthing/syncthing"

# Directories: Format like -v/--volume. Paths will be automatically prepended with this directory path
# This does not use docker volumes, just host directory bind mounts.
# Ex: config becomes -> "-v /usr/local/etc/docker/my_app/config"
#
# CONTAINER_DIRS="directory:/root/directory"
CONTAINER_DIRS="work:/var/syncthing"

# Ports: Format like -p/--port
# Will be prepended with the -p option
# Ex: 80:80/tcp -> "-p 80:80/tcp"
#
# CONTAINER_PORTS="80:80/tcp 443:443/tcp"
#
# 8384 web ui
# 22000 TCP transfer
# 22000 UDP transfer
# 21027 Discovery packets

# Capabilities: Format like --cap-add (these are only added, everything is DROPPED by default)
# Will be prepended with --cap-add
# Ex: NET_ADMIN NET_BIND_SERVICE -> "--cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE"
#
# CONTAINER_CAPS="NET_BIND_SERVICE NET_ADMIN"
CONTAINER_CAPS="CHOWN DAC_OVERRIDE SETGID SETUID"

# User: Override the --user option passed to the container.
# Pass UID instead of names for maximum compatibility.
# This user will be parsed into the --user=uid:gid format,
# where the UID is the resolved UID of the provided user, and the group
# is the users primary Group.
# Ex: root -> --user=0:0
# Ex: myuser -> --user=1000:1000
# Ex: 700 -> --user=700:700
#
# CONTAINER_USER="1000"

# Options: Any options passed to the container raw
# Passed directory to docker run
# 
# CONTAINER_OPTIONS="-i -t --read-only"
#
# Unset STGUIADDRESS since we configure it through the web GUI
# syncthing expects files to be owned by a user 1000 by default, which works fine in many Linux cases.
# On MacOS though, our user is 501:20 normally, so we override the PUID and PGID here to the current running
# user
CONTAINER_OPTIONS="-e STGUIADDRESS= -e STNODEFAULTFOLDER=1 --init"

# Arguments: Passed directly to the command ran inside the container.
# If arguments are passed at invocation time, those will be used instead of these default args.
