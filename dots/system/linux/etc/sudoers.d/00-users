# This must be first, as a future NOPASSWD command would be overridden otherwise
#
# Sudo reads these files in order. This file goes first to declare that <<MY_USER>> can perform
# any command as root.

# Then future files declare things like NOPASSWD needed when entering certain approved commands.
<<MY_USER>> ALL=(root) ALL
